# IPL-Data-Analysis
# 🏏 IPL Data Preprocessing and Analysis Project

This project focuses on preprocessing and analyzing data from IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket matches using Python and popular data analysis libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Ensure data integrity and consistency between the `matches.csv` and `deliveries.csv` datasets.
- Perform detailed data cleaning, handling missing values, and standardizing categorical entries.
- Engineer meaningful features such as match year and total match runs to enrich analysis.
- Generate summary statistics and initial insights including top scorers, wicket-takers, and team performances.
- Detect outliers in delivery data using statistical methods.
- Visualize patterns and trends in the IPL datasets using various plots.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Checked for and handled missing values.
- Cleaned and standardized team names.
- Merged datasets for deeper insights.
- Converted date columns to proper datetime objects.
- Created new feature columns such as `match_year` and `total_runs_in_match`.

### 2. Summary Statistics
- Count of total matches and runs.
- Top 5 run scorers and wicket takers.
- Team-wise run contributions.
- Average runs scored per over.

### 3. Data Transformation
- Used IQR method to detect outlier deliveries.
- Ensured consistency across merged data columns.

### 4. Visual Analysis
- Bar plots for top scorers, wicket takers, and team totals.
- Line plot for average runs per over.
